Hand Gesture–Based Virtual Mouse 

Using MediaPipe, OpenCV, PyAutoGUI & Pynput

Project Overview - 

This project implements a hand gesture–controlled virtual mouse system using MediaPipe Hands and computer vision. The system tracks real-time hand landmarks from a webcam feed and maps specific hand gestures to mouse actions such as cursor movement, left click, right click, double click, and screenshot capture.

Although the project was developed earlier, it was pushed to GitHub on 5th January due to issues with the previous GitHub account.
